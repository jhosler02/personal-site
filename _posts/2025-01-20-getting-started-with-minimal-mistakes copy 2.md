This is a sample post to demonstrate how posts work in the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme. The theme provides a clean and modern design that's perfect for personal blogs and portfolios.

## Features

Minimal Mistakes includes many great features:

- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark mode support
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks look great
- **SEO Optimized**: Built with search engines in mind

## Customization

You can easily customize the theme by:

1. Modifying the `_config.yml` file
2. Adding custom CSS in `_sass/custom.scss`
3. Overriding theme layouts in `_layouts`
4. Creating custom includes in `_includes`

## Example Code Block

Here's an example of a Python code snippet:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Greet someone by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Feel free to explore the theme documentation for more customization options!
